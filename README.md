# NetBeans2
Trying to get net beans to use a remote repository on github. I think I finally got one step working - namely creating a local project and shoving it to a remote repository.

You need to
1. create a project
2. use Team>Git>Initialize Repository  // so git tracks locally
3. Team>Comit // so that git knows that you want to keep the local files
4. Create a Repository on gitHub and copy the HTTPS location that you get
5. use Team>Remote>Push // fill in copied HTTPS link, git user name and password

and in theory it is there. This only took 2 days and a couple tutorials. Now we see if someone else can get at the repository.
